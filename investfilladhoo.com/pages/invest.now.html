    <h1>Investment Options</h1>
    
    <div class="background2">
    <p>
      This section presents the investment options along with the room categories and core concepts behind each of our two properties. It outlines how we plan to develop the guest houses in a way that highlights their unique appeal while helping investors clearly see the potential for strong returns. One of our key strategies is to build different facilities across both locations. Guests staying at either property will have full access to all amenities, creating a single, unified resort experience. This model reduces construction costs while offering a wider variety of services, including dining, entertainment, and leisure activities. As the properties are only five minutes apart by buggy, this shared-access approach is both efficient and guest-friendly.
