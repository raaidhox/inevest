    <h2>External Environment Analysis</h2>
    <div class="background2">
    <p>
      It is very important to scan the external business environment, and hence a PESTEL analysis has been conducted. Below are some key opportunities and threats that may influence the performance of the guest house:
    </p>

    <h3>Political:</h3>
    <p>
      Maldives' current political environment is stable and peaceful. Government policies promoting SMEs, along with financing support from institutions like SDFC Bank, create favorable conditions for guest house businesses. Tourism Master Plans and tax-relief incentives for SMEs further enhance viability.
    </p>

    <h3>Ecological:</h3>
    <p>
      As a low-lying nation vulnerable to climate change, the Maldives has embraced eco-conscious initiatives. Our business model aligns with this vision through sustainable, eco-friendly guest house practices. The focus on conservation and wildlife tourism adds further opportunity.
    </p>

    <h3>Social:</h3>
    <p>
      The concept of local guest houses is widely accepted in Maldivian society. Growing domestic demand for tourism, coupled with increasing local incomes and population, supports long-term sustainability. The absence of major public health concerns allows smooth guest movement across islands.
    </p>

    <h3>Technological:</h3>
    <p>
      Integration of digital platforms—including e-commerce, e-travel systems, and online booking portals—is central to our operations. A strong online presence and access to tech-enhanced hospitality tools will allow us to attract international and local travelers efficiently.
    </p>

    <h3>Economical:</h3>
    <p>
      Despite limited market size within the Maldives, our focus is international. The economy is growing at a GDP rate of 6% annually, with South Asian economies like India also rising. Internal lending rates are at 11.75% and inflation (CPI) at 6%.
    </p>

    <h3>Legal:</h3>
    <p>
      The Maldives supports private enterprise through various laws and acts, including the Company Act and Employment Act. However, licenses and compliance with quality standards are required for tourism-related developments. This includes adherence to construction codes and health and safety standards.

    <h1>Investment Options</h1>
    
    <div class="background2">
    <p>
      This section presents the investment options along with the room categories and core concepts behind each of our two properties. It outlines how we plan to develop the guest houses in a way that highlights their unique appeal while helping investors clearly see the potential for strong returns. One of our key strategies is to build different facilities across both locations. Guests staying at either property will have full access to all amenities, creating a single, unified resort experience. This model reduces construction costs while offering a wider variety of services, including dining, entertainment, and leisure activities. As the properties are only five minutes apart by buggy, this shared-access approach is both efficient and guest-friendly.
